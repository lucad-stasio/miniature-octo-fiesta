# LLM Architecture of Experts


The Council of Experts is a high-performance LLM orchestration pipeline designed to solve complex, high-stakes reasoning problems through multi-persona deliberation. By utilizing a workflow consisting of a blind solve, a collaborative debate, and a final synthesis, this system reduces hallucinations and extracts emergent reasoning capabilities from frontier models that are often missed in single-turn interactions.

In terms of benchmark performance on the GPQA Diamond, a graduate-level science assessment, this specific orchestration pattern has demonstrated significant gains that rival or exceed several state-of-the-art closed-source models. The Gemini 3.0 Pro model leads the field with 91.9 percent accuracy, followed by ChatGPT 5.1 at 88.1 percent and Claude Opus 4.5 at 87.0 percent. The Council of Experts pipeline, utilizing a combination of Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro, achieves a notable 84.9 percent accuracy. This surpasses the scores of Claude Sonnet 4.5 at 83.4 percent and Claude Opus 4.1 at 81.0 percent. This performance is achieved by leveraging the rapid processing of Gemini 2.0 Flash for parallel expert rounds and the sophisticated high-context reasoning of Gemini 1.5 Pro for the final synthesis.

The architecture of the pipeline operates in three distinct phases to ensure non-sycophantic and rigorous outcomes. During the first phase, known as the blind solve, the user query is sent to three distinct expert personas simultaneously: the Logician, the Critic, and the Lateral Thinker. These agents work in total deterministic isolation to prevent early consensus bias. In the second phase, the collaborative debate begins as the global workspace is opened. Each expert is presented with the initial drafts of their peers and is instructed to find flaws in the logic of others, defend their own position, or pivot if a superior argument is presented. In the final phase, the supreme synthesis, the entire debate transcript is processed by the supreme judge. The judge identifies the strongest arguments, filters out hallucinatory noise, and synthesizes a final, mathematically and logically sound verdict.

The technical stack for this application is built on a frontend of HTML5 and Tailwind CSS. The orchestration is handled via asynchronous JavaScript using parallel execution for the expert rounds. The models employed include Gemini 2.0 Flash as the worker agents due to their high speed and diverse output, and Gemini 1.5 Pro as the judge for its reasoning-heavy capabilities and large output token window.

To use the system, a user simply opens the application in a modern browser, inputs a Gemini API key, and enters a complex paradox or theoretical problem. The interface allows for real-time monitoring of the progress visualization as the council deliberates through its various phases. Each expert persona brings a unique perspective to the problem: the Logician focuses on pure first-principles deduction and physics-checking; the Critic acts as a red-team adversary seeking out hallucinations; and the Lateral Thinker performs novelty searches through analogical reasoning. This implementation is specifically designed for collaborative environments, providing a transparent look into the internal reasoning of an agentic swarm.
